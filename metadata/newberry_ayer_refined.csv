He was justly honored and esteemed by all who knew him."" ""Struck by the Ree was born when Lewis and Clark were being entertained by the Sioux in camp at Greene Island, Yankton, Sept., 1804. When Capt. Lewis heard of his birth in one of the Indian lodges, he sent for the child and wrapped it in the American flag and made a speech in which he prophesied he would become eminent among his people and a great friend to the white men. He became head chief of the Yankton Sioux and was probably the means of saving the entire settlement at Yankton from massacre in the 'War of the Outbreak' in 1863.

","Contemporary copy of Father Bernardino de Sahagún's 1574 correction and reworking of an anonymous compilation of Biblical readings and meditations in Nahuatl. An introductory section of five pages is followed by meditations based on readings from the Gospels for each day of the week, beginning with Monday. Themes from the readings include the angel's announcement of the birth of Christ to the shepherds; the young Jesus teaching the elders in the temple; and Christ establishing the sacrament of Holy Communion. The tri-lingual meditation on the Eucharist contains the liturgy in Latin, followed by Spanish glosses, and explanations in Nahuatl of the ceremony and its significance.",Text,"All rights reserved by the Newberry Library.

","Two copies of Sahagún's earlier ""addiciones"" to the Postilla, a textual fragment of a larger series of admonitions, and a concluding appendix added in 1579. 1486A and 1486B are both copies of the additions: 1486A, entitled ""Nican vnpeoa yn nemachtiliz tlatolli,"" is the complete version, signed by Sahagún, with titles and text in Nahuatl, and ""cut and paste"" corrections; while 1486B is incomplete, with titles in Spanish. The additions explain the three theological virtues: Faith (ch. 1-3), Hope (ch. 4), and Charity (ch. 5-9). Chapters 11-24 concern specific examples of the virtues, such as charity towards one's neighbors; charity towards oneself; love of one's enemies; and neighborly love. The final three chapters describe the punishments of hell; the rewards of virtue in the glories of heaven; and death and the day of judgment. The fragment of text accompanying the appendix (1486C) contains moral and doctrinal admonitions or ""tenonotzaliztli,"" condemning native rituals. The appendix (1486D), copied by one of Sahagún’s scribes, Alonso Vegerano, also condemns Indian religious beliefs, with special emphasis on the role of the devil in Indian life.",Text,"All rights reserved by the Newberry Library.

The Roberts family left their New York home in the summer of 1831 and travelled to Illinois by horse and wagon settling in Pleasant Grove Prairie. The diaries contain much information on the following topics: routine farm activities, farming expenses and property valuations, illnesses and medicinal cures, family births and deaths, local events, and weather conditions. Prior to settlement in Illinois, Roberts was engaged as an apprentice to a lithographic firm in New York City. In the first two volumes he describes the technical aspects of making lithographic plates as well as an earlier trip he made in 1830 to St. Louis and Illinois returning home via New Orleans. The collection of diaries also includes his first wife's (Mary W. Burhans) account of their trip to Morton in 1831 and his second wife's (Ann Waters) account of a trip to New England she made in 1859.

","The most significant transcontinental journey in U.S. history, the Lewis and Clark Expedition was not only recorded in the journals and observations of the two captains, but also by four other members of the party. Private Joseph Whitehouse maintained during the expedition a journal consisting of extensive field notes bound in a single volume of three parts, the extant portion covering the period May 14, 1804 to November 6, 1805. Upon returning to St. Louis in the fall of 1806, Whitehouse had prepared by a copyist this new and expanded journal, May 14, 1804 - April 6, 1806, with the intent of having it published. This paraphrased version of the original journal includes a preface and fills in some gaps lacking in the original.",Text,"All rights reserved by the Newberry Library.

","1830 volume. The diaries of John M. Roberts primarily focus on his family's daily farm life in Tazewell County. The Roberts family left their New York home in the summer of 1831 and travelled to Illinois by horse and wagon settling in Pleasant Grove Prairie. The diaries contain much information on the following topics: routine farm activities, farming expenses and proberty valuations, illnesses and medicinal cures, family births and deaths, local events, and weather conditions. Prior to settlement in Illinois, Roberts was engaged as an apprentice to a lithographic firm in New York City. In the first two volumes he describes the technical aspects of making lithographic plates as well as an earlier trip he made in 1830 to St. Louis and Illinois returning home via New Orleans. The collection of diaries also includes his first wife's (Mary W. Burhans) account of their trip to Morton in 1831 and his second wife's (Ann Waters) account of a trip to New England she made in 1859. A few volumes contain miscellaneous sketches of Robert's home and towns he visited in Illinois.",Text,"All rights reserved by the Newberry Library.

Canticles for the church year from Christmas to Easter are based on the New Testament events of the life of Christ: the Nativity, the presentation of gifts by the Magi during Epiphany; the Purification of the Virgin; the flight into Egypt; the baptism of Christ by John the Baptist; the election of Apostles; Christ's miracles; the resurrection of Lazarus; and the Crucifixion.
