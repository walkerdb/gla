    <dc:creator>Lewis, James Otto.</dc:creator>
    <dc:subject>Black Hawk, Sauk chief, 1767-1838; Sauk Indians; Tribal Chiefs; Indians of North America; Portraits; Lithographs</dc:subject>
    <dc:description>
Description on opposite page:  This chief was born in the month of August, 1766, at the village of Car-kie-o-mar, or







the Eagle village, on the Mississippi river, lying between







the Rock river and the Des Moines. His father, whose name







was Par-ise, or the Spirit, was a full Sac Indian, and his







mother, who was named O-ne-go-qua, or the White woman, was a







Pottowattomie squaw. The latter was one of six wives, who







all but herself belonged to the Sac nation, was married near







Chicago in the state of Illinois, and bore her husband two







children. Par-ise was made a war chief by the English at the







time Montcalm was defeated by their forces at Quebec, on







account of the assistance which, in common with the Indian







auxiliaries, he afforded to their arms; but soon afterward,







in the year 1780, he met a tragic end. Whilst hunting up the







Mississippi river, he was attacked by wolves, when he







defended himself with desperate valour, but in the contest







accidentally discharged his gun, the contents of which







passed through his body, and he expired on the spot, his







wife dying soon after him.  In the year 1800, Black Hawk,







the subject of this notice, married Man-wa-qua, or the







Female Wolf, daughter of Sha-e-qua by O-ou-nis-ka, a noted







and brave chief, who fell in a skirmish with the Sioux







tribe, some distance up the Mississippi. For many years but







little was known of the character of Black Hawk, by the







white settlers bordering on the Indian reservation of the







Sacs, with whom he had always lived in peace and amity. In







1832, how-ever, he commenced a fierce hostility towards the







whites, without any known cause of aggression, and was the







leader of a series of atrocities, which for a long time kept







the borders in a state of great alarm and danger, making war







indiscriminately upon the de-fenceless inhabitants,







slaughtering whole families, burning their dwelling-houses,







and destroying their property and crops, thousands of







persons fleeing in every direction to escape his savage







attacks. As soon as the intelligence came to the United







States Government, a strong body of troops, under the







command of Generals Atkinson and Scott, were marched to the







spot to punish the aggressions and cruelties of the Indians,







who were, after a succession of skirmishes, finally subdued.







The war terminated by Black Hawk, his brother Napope the







prophet, with his son, and some of the principal







instigators, being made prisoners and taken to Washington.







The imbecile attempt at making war with, and disputing the







authority of, the United States, was severely reprimanded by







President Jackson, who, displacing Black Hawk from his







command as chief, appointed to that post, Keokuck, another







Sac Indian, who had always shewn a more friendly feeling







towards the whites, and was not concerned in the







perpetration of any of the recent outrages.   After







remaining but a short time in confinement, Black Hawk was







dismissed, and returned home. In his way back, he passed







through the principal cities of the Union, where his







appearance excited great curiosity, from his







recently-acquired renown, and he received very considerable







attention. So general was this manifested, that many ladies







of the first distinction visited him during his progress,







and by their soothing courtesy and many valuable presents,







endeavored to alleviate the depressed spirit of the devoted







and fallen chief. After witnessing the extent of the







country, and its vast strength and resources -- which to







this untutored child of the forest were matters of great







interest and surprise -- he was not backwards in







acknowledging the folly of contending with a people, who, he







said, were as thick as the   leaves of the forest.  Since







his return, he has remained perfectly quiet, nor is it







probable that his influence will again be used in disturbing







the tranquility which at present exists in this part of the







United States, so lately rendered the scene of turmoil







through his means.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>
Description on opposite page:  This chief was the son of a







French Indian trader, born in Montreal, whose name was







Babtiste Grammont, by a Winnebago squaw, whom he married, at







the same time settling with the tribe, who own an extensive







tract of country between the Fox, Wisconsin, and Mississippi







rivers, in the territory of Michigan, North America. Several







children were the result of this marriage, of whom







Tshu-gue-ga was the eldest. At an early age he was







characterized by a crafty and cruel disposition; and one







time, in a trivial dispute with his uncle, assassinated him,







by planting his tomahawk in his skull. He was also one of







the foremost at various depredations that were committed







upon the white settlements; and the acts of rapine in which







he was engaged were not unfrequently attended with bloodshed







and murder, and scenes of the most horrid barbarity. He was







at one time, at the head of his followers, the perpetrator







of the massacre of nearly a whole and defense-less family on







the Upper Mississippi, a short time previous to the







commencement of the last American war. The victims were, a







family of squatters, as the settlers are generally termed,







consisting of a man, his wife, and three children. The







husband was absent on a hunting excursion, when Tshu-gue-ga







and his party arrived at the house, and demanded whiskey.







The wife, not being in possession of any, and consequently







unable to comply with their request, the merciless savages







became so enraged, that they not only scalped her, and







tomahawked the youthful children, but after rifling the







house of its principal contents, set it on fire. The







husband, on his return home, fortunately perceived the







light, and suspecting the presence of Indians in the







neighbourhood, secreted himself in a jungle until







night-time, when he made his escape to the nearest American







post. Scouts were immediately despatched in pursuit of the







perpetrators of this tragedy, who, however, from their







superior fleetness, evaded the pursuers, and regained their







tribe in safety.  At the time he was seen by the author of







this work, Tshu-gue-ga appeared to be about forty-five years







of age. His height was rather upwards of six feet, and he







was remarkably strong and athletic -- so much so, that no







chief on the treaty ground could contend with him either in







running or wrestling. He was also very expert in fishing and







in hunting, and has been known to bring down twenty deer in







one day. From his skill in hunting, and his bravery, -- in







which he had often distinguished himself, -- he was soon







celebrated amongst the Winnebagoes, and appointed a war







chief, shortly after which he endeavored to involve his







tribe in a war with the government of the United States; but







a timely arrival of troops on the Mississippi, in 1827, soon







dispersed and quieted them, and maintained peace, in which







they have continued to remain, with but little disturbance







to the general tranquility.  Tshu-gue-ga had three wives and







a large family, to whom his conduct was as tyrannical and







cruel as towards others. He was killed about two years







since, in a drunken quarrel, by one of his band, to whom his







arbitrary behaviour had rendered him very obnoxious. His







costume was composed of a head-dress of feathers, with a







crow-skin round his neck. He wore a blanket, and carried a







spear, decorated with ribbons, beads, and other trinkets.







One side of his face was painted black, he at the time being







in mourning for the death of his second wife.</dc:description>

Description on opposite page:  It is impossible, in the







short sketch allotted to these notices, to convey any







accurate description of' this celebrated chief of the







Chippewa tribe of Indians, who inhabit a very extensive







portion of the northwestern territory of the United States







of America, or to do justice to those characters for which







he is particularly distinguished -- his powers of eloquence,







and acts of bravery and valor. Descended from an illustrious







line of ancestry, who by feats of' skill in hunting, and







heroism in war, obtained extensive renown, he soon, by







imitating their conduct, so gained upon the respect and







affection of his tribe, that before he had reached the age







of thirty, he was considered one of the foremost of the







band. At the time the accompanying sketch was taken, he bad







attained the age of eighty-two, and notwithstanding the







numerous wars and skirmishes in which he had been engaged,







the many wounds he had received, and his constant exposure







to the privation and hardships consequent upon a savage







life, he still maintained an unusual degree of vigor and







energy. At the time the author saw him, he resided at the







Sault de St. Marie, a military post of the United States,







situate at the outlet of Lake Superior, though he generally







lived at the hunting-grounds belonging to the Chippewa







nation, west of the lake, and was surrounded by a large







family, who principally subsisted by hunting and fishing. 







At the treaty which was held at Fond du Lac, in 1826, with







the Chippewa tribe and the Government Commissioners, for the







purpose of re-establishing peace between them and other







tribes, as well as to ratify a former treaty held at Prairie







du Chien, in 1825, this chief addressed the commissioners in







the following manner: -- 'My Father, we feel our hearts glad







in meeting you at this council fire; we should not speak







truth were we to say otherwise. My Father, many moons have







passed since you last visited your red children, and your







now coming gives us joy. We have heard our fathers talk, and







we listened with attention; we will take time to think on







what you have said, and then will give you an answer; we







want our great Father at Washington (the president) to think







of' his red children; the Great Spirit made us all; the red







chief and the white chief', and he has given us an unclouded







sky to meet you in council. We hope our Father will give his







red children blankets, some rifles, with lead, and tobacco,







also some fire water [whiskey], when we meet him to-morrow.'







Shing-gaa-ba-wosin was at first strenuously opposed to the







cession of the lands be-longing to his tribe to the







government of' the United States, strongly contending for







the rights of his people, who he considered were oppressed







by the innovation of the white settlers, and frequently







intimating his intention to dispute every aggression at the







point of the scalping-knife and tomahawk. Every effort was







made to induce him to yield to the wishes of the







commissioners, nor was it until the danger and disadvantage







that would accrue to his tribe were fairly pointed out, and,







on the other hand, the benefits that would result from an







acquiescence on his part, that he at last conceded.  An







anecdote was related to the author by a gentleman of







veracity, which strongly exhibits the shrewdness and







sagacity of this chief. At a treaty held some time since







with his tribe, commissioners had been sent by the







government to obtain some Indian reservations, the titles of







which it was considered desirable to extinguish by an







amicable arrangement and purchase. Amongst the several







chiefs that attended was Shing-gaa-ba-wosin, to whom every







overture was made by the commissioners, in order to induce







him to accede to their request, but without success. He







every day attended the meetings of the council, but







preserved a studied silence, notwithstanding that, from







being a chief of great influence, every means were exerted







to bring him over to the views of the commissioners. One







day, a short time after the council had adjourned, one of







the commissioners had retired, and was seated on the stump







of a fallen tree. Shing-gaa-ba-wosin approached with







measured steps, and seated himself closely behind the







commissioner, who, thinking it was done unintentionally,







removed a short distance, where he was followed by the







persevering chief. The commissioner again removed, but this







only brought the chief again to his side, when the former







having reached the edge of the log, the latter exerted all







his strength and pushed him to the ground.







Shing-gaa-ba-wosin, rising with his native dignity and







grace, then addressed himself to the prostrate com-missioner







in the following manner: -- 'There, my Father, that is the







way in which you serve your poor red children; the Great







Spirit hears me, and I will speak. I came and asked you for







a seat on which to rest my limbs -- you gave it to me. Not







contented with this, I urged you for more until you gave it;







and I again demanded more, until you had none left. Many







moons ago, our Father crossed the Big-water [Atlantic







Ocean], and begged of his red children a small piece of







land, on which he might build his wigwam. It was given him;







but not being satisfied, he again asked his red children for







more. This was given, and still more, until his red children







abandoned the homes and hunting-grounds of their fathers, to







make way for the white man. Now when the great chiefs and







braves of their nations are at rest, our Father is for







sending us farther west, to where the sun sets, and sinks







into the Big Lake [Pacific Ocean] from where we can never







see its rising again.'    Costume. -- The head-dress is







composed of skin, ornamented with feathers, ribbons, and







beads. Part of his face was painted with vermilion; his arms







were decorated with silver bands, and from his neck was







suspended a silver medal, bearing the impress of the







President of the United States. As customary with the







Indians, a blanket constituted his outer robe.</dc:description>

Description on opposite page:  The sketch of this celebrated







chief was taken in 1825 when he was in command of the Sioux







tribe who inhabit a vast extent of territory on the Upper







Mississippi in the northwest part of the United States of







America. The occasion of meeting was at the great treaty







held at Prairie du Chien, a small town on the Mississippi







between a large body composed of Chippewas, Winnebagoes,







Pottowattomies, Sioux, Sacs, Foxes, and other Indian tribes







when the commissioners on the part of the United States were















the Honorable Lewis Cass, at present minister















plenipotentiary from this country to the court of France,















and Governor William Clark of Missouri.  Of the birth or















parentage of this distinguished chief but little knowledge















could be obtained by the author. The principal events of his















life and which have gained him great distinction amongst the















native tribes transpired during the late war between the















United States and Great Britain, in which he aided the cause















of the latter. At the time this sketch was taken, he wore on















his head nineteen small red sticks, emblematical of the















number of scalps which he had taken during this war; his















breast was scarred by numerous wounds, and he showed the















mark of a bullet which had passed through his arm. He was















then apparently fifty years of age, but retained all vigor















and alacrity of youth with very fine muscular as well as















mental powers. In time of peace, his employment consists















chiefly in hunting the wild buffalo. In this hazardous















employment, mounted on a fleet Indian charger and armed with















bows and arrows, he would sally undaunted into the middle of















the wildest herd where, planting his arrows promiscuously,















he would again rapidly retreat, leaving the victims of his















unerring aim quietly to perish, weltering in their gore. 















The dress in which he was enveloped, as represented in the















sketch, and highly characteristic of his favorite pursuits,















consists of a buffalo skin dressed and ornamented with dyed















porcupine quills. On his head he wears a plume of eagle's















feathers with the pieces of red sticks before mentioned from















which descend large strands of horse hair, dyed red. In his















right hand he holds a gun, decorated with feathers and in















his left a fan, composed of black horse hair. On his feet















are moccasins, to which were attached foxes' tails. His















height exceeded six feet and his appearance in his native















costume was both singular and magnificent.  In the















background of this plate is represented the style and















appearance of the native wigwams, or places of residence.</dc:description>

Description on opposite page:  This chief resides to the







south of the Fox River in the territory of Michigan, in







North America, where he is much respected on account of his







friendly disposition towards the white settlers, his







character being peaceable and mild. In the war between Great







Britain and the United States, in 1812, he maintained a







system of rigid neutrality, aiding neither of the







belligerent parties, which, however, frequently exposed him







to circumstances of difficulty. His brother, called the 







Walking Thunder,  took an active part in favour of the







British, and was present at the siege of Fort Meigs, on the







Miami river; at the battle of the river Rasin, in Michigan;







and finally, at the engagement on the river Thames, in Upper







Canada, where he was killed. Ma-ko-me-ta has three wives, by







whom he has a family of six children, who, with his aged







father and sister, comprise his household.   In his early







youth, Ma-ko-me-ta narrowly escaped death under the







following circumstances : -- A destructive war had for some







time been pending between the Menomomies and the







Winnebagoes, in which his father took an active part. The







former being defeated in an engagement, fled precipitately







from the field of battle, but being pursued by the enemy,







they were overtaken, when a savage slaughter of the







vanquished party ensued. Amongst those who were saved on the







field and made prisoners, but only to be reserved for more







signal punishment, from their consequence in the tribe, were







the subject of this sketch and his father. The arms of the







latter were bound, and, thus disabled, he was driven before







the band of the victorious Winnebagoes, the son, who was







mounted on a horse, following behind one of the chiefs. When







evening approached, the party halted to encamp, where,







having made a large fire and partaken of food they lay down







to rest, enveloped in their blankets, first securing the







prisoners by tying their arms together, and attaching the







cord which bound them to the foot of the guard, Ma-ko-me-ta,







them only twelve years of age, being placed between his







father and the sleeping savage. In the middle of the night,







the youth weeping and complaining bitterly of the pain which







he suffered from the tightness of the cord which bound his







arms, the guard granted him some indulgence by loosening it,







and setting one arm at liberty. Ma-ko-me-ta looking upon







this as a chance by which he might aid the escape of his







father as well as himself, kept awake until a short time







before day-break, when, finding the Indian soundly enveloped







in sleep, he softly took from him his tomahawk, with which







severing the remaining cord which bound himself, he next







released his father. They then both made a hasty retreat,







and long before the Indians were aware of their loss, were







far beyond the reach of pursuit.   The brother of







Ma-ko-me-ta's father, whose name was Man-o-que-o-waa, was,







under circumstances of less apprehension, not so fortunate







as his nephew, meeting his death from the hands of a female







prisoner whom he had charge of. He was of a very opposite







disposition to the latter, being of a cruel and savage







temper, and was an object of terror to the white







settlements, from his depredations and atrocities, in







company with other chiefs as unprincipled and cruel as







himself. On one occasion he had, along with seven other







chiefs, been engaged in a series of robberies, and after a







long journey up the Mississippi, attacked a farm-house







belonging to a settler of the name of Burns, whom they







killed along with his wife, and after rifting and then







setting fire to the house, took away his two daughters as







prisoners, one of whom was fifteen and the other about







eighteen years of age. On their retreat, they compelled the







young women to walk, treating them with great cruelty,







until, having marched a distance of upwards of twenty miles







through a very dreary country, the Indians resolved upon







separating, leaving the two sisters and the spoils with







Man-o-que-o-waa, whilst they took an opposite direction in







search of more plunder. Man-o-que-o-waa was mounted on a







horse having a bag of wheat-flour behind him, taken from the







farm-house. Shortly after the other Indians had left, he







dismounted, and placing the bag on the ground, sat down near







it, took out his tobacco pouch, and began smoking, at the







same time ordering the girls, whose hands were bound, to sit







opposite to him. It soon after commenced raining, when the







eldest daughter intimated, by signs to the chief, that the







flour would get wet, but that if he would unbind her arms,







and let her have the use of his tomahawk, she would cut some







branches of trees and place over it to protect it.







Unconscious of any danger to be apprehended from such a







feeble enemy, he consented to her proposals, and she went







and cut some, until getting unseen and unsuspectingly behind







the chief, she raised the heavy axe with both her hands over







his devoted head, looking for seeming approbation at her







sister, who sat opposite. It was a moment of intense anxiety







for both, when the latter, in terror and fright, but with







ideas of sweet revenge for the murder of their parents,







nodded her consent, and the next instant the uplifted







tomahawk sunk deep in the skull of the miscreant chieftain,







who, uttering a loud cry, sunk inanimate to the ground. The







intrepid avenger of her parents' death quickly unbound her







sister, when, mounting the horse, they both swiftly fled,







nor stopped in their career until they arrived at a small







village at a distance, where they gave an alarm. Pursuit was







immediately made after the other Indians, but without







success.  Ma-ko-me-ta is five feet eight or nine inches in







height, and very robust. He wore on his head a black







handkerchief and eagle's feathers. From his neck was







suspended a scalping-knife. He constantly wore a blanket.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>
Description on opposite page:  The subject of this notice was a chief of the Chippewa nation of Indians, whose reservations of land extended from the south-western shores of Lake Superior to the Upper Mississippi river. His character and prowess as a warrior were established long before his death; the recollections of his bravery and his valor are not forgotten in the war songs and dances of his tribe; and the name of Kitch-ee-I-aa-ba is a sufficient spell to rouse the warrior from his lair, and excite all his dormant energies. From his reputation, the author was extremely anxious to obtain some full particulars of a man who adorned the rough exterior of savage life by the exercise of those noble spirits and qualities which that unrestrained condition alone can develop, but could only procure the following particulars, which must suffice as an outline of his character. Kitch-ee-I-aa-ba was the son of Soo-cu-ris-kee, a Sac chief, who married the daughter of O-be-gis-qua, a full Chippewa chief. Soo-cu-ris-ke, his father, was killed on the 4th of September, 1791, at an engagement on the Miami river, near Fort Jefferson, when the Americans, under General Arthur St. Clair, were defeated by the Indians. Kitch-ee-I-aa-ba was then about twenty years of age, and after his father fell, took every opportunity of revenging his death by the indiscriminate slaughter of the opposing forces. At the head of his warlike countrymen, he was for some time an object of fear, and gained many advantages over his enemies, until he was in his turn compelled to fly. On this occasion, an incident happened well calculated to awaken the sympathetic susceptibilities even of an Indian heart. Kitch-ee-I-aa-ba loved an Indian maid, and his betrothed sharing with him the fearful chances of the battle, was severely wounded. He had already seen his father fall beneath the saber of the white man, but nothing daunted, his brave soul repelled all fear as it disdained compromise. He still continued to fight bravely, until the unerring bullet found its way to the heart of his beloved. At once, the madness unsubdued even by the reasoning instinct of the animal whose name he bore, agitated his whole frame. In one arm he bore her, bleeding and dying, from the battle field, following in the rear of the flying savages, while frequently would he turn and desperately face the advancing foe, until nature sank, and he fell under the afflicting burden. Sad and forlorn, however, he again rallied with sufficient strength; the din of arms had ceased, and he bore the inanimate body of his betrothed to a neighboring thicket, where scooping out a shallow grave with his scalping-knife, he deposited her inanimate body. Covering the place hallowed as the depository of the remains of the beauteous Indian maid with the fallen leaves of the forest, he smoked the pipe of grief upon the grave of one so pure, but so unfortunate -- the last sad honors that love requires from a savage votary.































































The author could glean but few other incidents of his career. When the sketch was taken, he was dressed in a hunting shirt and blanket. On his head he wore a bear -skin cap, from which descended large strands of horse-hair. He had round his neck a black handkerchief, and a necklace, formed of bone and brass wire. On one half of his face was painted with vermilion.</dc:description>

Description on opposite page:  The spot where this chief resides is nearly two hundred miles from the northwestern part of Fond du Lac, on the extreme verge of Lake Superior,















in North America. His father, whose name was Men-dow-min, or















the Corn, married the daughter of Me-no- quet, another















member of the same tribe. The Berry Picker was the eldest of















three children, and at an early age evinced a savage and















morose, disposition. His father, in order to curb his















temper, often refused or neglected to take him either to the















war or hunting excursions in which be was engaged; but at















the age of fifteen, the youth, un willing to be restrained,















actually forced his way into the camp of the enemy, unknown















to his father, who was then on his return from the















engagement, bearing a scalp.  The following incident















relating to this chief occurred at a very early period of















his life, and at the same time evinces, in some measure, the















system usually adopted by the Indians in training their















children, by inuring them to hardships, and enabling them to















endure pain or torture without grief or murmurs: -- An















English gentleman traveling through the Indian country, and















being overtaken by a storm, stopped with his interpreter for















shelter at the wigwam of Men-dow-min. Seated in a circle















around the fire, along with the proprietor of the hut were















several other chiefs, engaged in smoking, with two squaws,















and three or four children, which party was joined by the















traveller and his interpreter, who were anxious spectators















of whatever occurred. The Berry Picker, who was then but















three years old, in his juvenile play stumbled over the















stranger's foot, and falling towards the fire, burnt his















finger slightly. Upon his crying out on account of the pain,















his father endeavored, but unsuccessfully, to soothe and















quiet him, when, to the astonishment of the Englishman, he















thrust his own finger into the embers, and holding it to the















child, said,  See, my child, I do not cry -- it is not brave















to cry -- be a chief as your father; see, he does not cry. 















This practical example appeared to have its required effect















even with this child of tender age, as instantly his weeping















ceased, and his lips were closed, and he looked up into the















face of his sire, with even more than his usual boldness. In















his after life it appeared as if this incident had not been















lost in the formation of his character, as a more determined















and desperate man never encountered danger nor braved a foe.















In the year 1825, be was present at the great council at















Prairie du Chien, where, although the presence of the















commissioners and the United States' troops prevented him















from exercising his malignant feelings towards the Sioux and















other tribes with whom he was at variance, in acts of open















hostility, he never failed to take every occasion which















opportunities presented, to show his animosity.  Another















incident, which exhibits in a very strong manner the marked















ferocity and malignity of his character, and in which the















life of a distinguished and talented citizen of the United















States might have been sacrificed, occurred at the period















just referred to. At the termination of the treaty, when















every article had been satisfactorily arranged, the















commissioners had decided upon giving the various assembled















tribes an entertainment, at which they would preside. On















this occasion, upwards of one hundred head of cattle were















slaughtered, and vast quantities of flour and pork were















added for the feast. A general belief, as well as desire,















was expressed by the Indians assembled, that their















hospitable entertainers would not be sparing in the















distribution of  father's milk,  as they sometimes term















whiskey. Aware of this desire, Governor Cass, one of the















commissioners, had provided a barrel on the ground, and















after the repast was finished, a small cup of this liquor















was handed round to each chief. They soon requested more,















when a similar allowance was repeated, but becoming inspired















by its influence, and insisting upon a still further supply,















the commissioner rose up, and overthrew the cask, spilling















the whole of its contents upon the ground. The Indians stood















aghast at this spoliation of their esteemed beverage, and at















what appeared to them a wanton and woeful waste. Governor















Cass, considering this a proper time to remonstrate on the















folly of drinking spirits to excess, and on the evil















consequences which ensued from a pernicious practice which















has attained such a destructive height amongst them, told















them  that whatever regret they might feel for the loss, for















himself he had none; that what he had done showed the little















value he attached to it, and that it was from a regard to















them alone that he had wasted the beverage.  The chiefs all















retired, sullen and discontented, and the Berry Picker















especially, who, casting at the commissioner a savage and















malignant glance, muttered some expressions not distinctly















heard by the interpreter, but which, it was afterwards















understood, contained a threat of assassination. This he















endeavored to carry into effect whilst the latter was















ascending the Fox river, by snapping his rifle at him,















which, however, fortunately missed fire, when the revengeful















chief made his escape into the woods.  The Berry Picker is















full six feet in height, and is drawn exactly according to















his appearance at the treaty. His head is embellished with















feathers, to which are suspended pieces of red cloth. A















circle of green is painted round his eyes, and his hair















hangs loose on his shoulders. He wore a cloth apron in















front, with red cloth leggings and moccasins, and in his















right hand carried a hunting-spear.</dc:description>

Sketchbook documenting Mayer's 1851 western journey. The sketchbook executed during his travels contain mainly pencil drawings made at Fort Snelling, Traverse des Sioux, and Mendota.  Included in the sketchbooks are portraits of Indians, soldiers, French voyageurs, half-breeds, and U.S. treaty officials. There are also many camp scenes (Indian ball-players,dances, etc.) and renderings of Indian dress and equipment. Mayer later completed sixty-five larger drawings and two oil portraits from the images recorded in his sketchbooks. In some cases, the sketchbook sources of the drawings are cited.</dc:description>
